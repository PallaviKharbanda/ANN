In this project, we will try to load fashion data from keras library and using artifical neural network will try to segment different categories of classes in that dataset.
Using different hyperparameters as optimizers, loss functions, dense layers, neurons, learning rate, we try to get the best model for our predictions and evaluate model accuracy
and increase it.
