In Fashion_Dateset_Classification_Using Neural Network project, we will try to load fashion data from keras library and using artifical neural network will try to segment different categories of classes in that dataset.
Using different hyperparameters as optimizers, loss functions, dense layers, neurons, learning rate, we try to get the best model for our predictions and evaluate model accuracy
and increase it.

In Customer Churn Prediction Model, we are building artificla neural network to predict customer churn class

In Handwritten digits Classification model, we are trying to classify the dgits using multi layer preceptron and different hyperparametrs to predict accurately 
the class of digits.
